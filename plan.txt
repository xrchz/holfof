Relevant papers:
- An LCF-Style Interface between HOL and First-Order Logic, Joe Hurd (CADE 2002)
- Translating Higher-Order Clauses to First-Order Clauses, Jia Meng and
  Lawrence C. Paulson (JAR 2008)

Pieces:
- conversion to rewrite abstractions in combinatory form
    - done at cam.xrchz.net/skico.cgi, reusing src/metis/normalForms
- predictable translation from an abstraction-free boolean goal term, plus
  axiom terms, to a FOF problem
- proof reconstruction from Metis kernel to OpenTheory kernel, including
  reverse translation from FOF
- similar to above but from TSTP format?
- (CNF or NNF conversions, maybe)
