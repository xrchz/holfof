Relevant papers:
- An LCF-Style Interface between HOL and First-Order Logic, Joe Hurd
- Translating Higher-Order Clauses to First-Order Clauses, Jia Meng and
  Lawrence C. Paulson

Pieces:
- conversion to rewrite abstractions in combinatory form
- predictable translation from an abstraction-free boolean goal term, plus
  axiom terms, to a FOF problem
- proof reconstruction from Metis kernel to OpenTheory kernel, including
  reverse translation from FOF
- similar to above but from TSTP format?
- (CNF or NNF conversions, maybe)
